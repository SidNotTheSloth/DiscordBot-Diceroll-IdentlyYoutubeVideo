# DiscordBot-Diceroll-IdentlyYoutubeVideo
This is a simple discord bot I made using Idently's video "Create Your Own Discord Bot in Python 3.12 Tutorial (2024 Edition)", refer to the README file for more details

Link to the youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYJDKSah-Ww&t=1s

Ideally I would suggest you watch the video, try to make it with him, and then refer to my file just in case you're stuck with some sort of syntax error and dont want to refer to an AI to help you.

If you are not going to watch his video and are rleying solely on my project file which once again I would not reccomend, here are a few things you should know :-
    Libraries :- Install python's discord library as well as the dotenv library

    Dotenv :- in this project we use the dotenv library to save the discord token of the chatbot in a secure dotenv file that will contian the discord token, it is a secrete       and so obviously I have not provided it here, you have to make the .env file yourself and get your discord token yourself.

    Responses :- The responses file contains the responses I have loaded in, they are slightly different to the ones in the video, the respones are very simple to make and         work on a simple if else type framework, you can make your own or do the same ones in the video, I have added a f*ck you response for when the user says a few bad words        lol, and for the dnd fans out there I have made a very simple generate character sheet response as well.

    I hope this repo aids you in making this discord bot :).
